Lockboxes Problem

Overview

This project implements a solution to the lockboxes problem. You are presented with n locked boxes, each containing a list of keys to other boxes. The objective is to determine whether all boxes can be opened starting from box 0, which is initially unlocked.

Requirements

Programming Language: Python 3.4+

Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

Code Style: PEP 8 (version 1.7.x)

Editor: vi, vim, or emacs

Execution Permissions: All files must be executable

Shebang: #!/usr/bin/python3 must be the first line of each Python file


Prototype

def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    """
    Determines if all boxes can be unlocked.
    
    Parameters:
    boxes (list of lists): A list where each index represents a box,
                           and the content is a list of keys to other boxes.

    Returns:
    bool: True if all boxes can be opened, False otherwise.
    """

Input

boxes is a list of lists, where:

The first box (boxes[0]) is unlocked by default.

Each box contains a list of keys that can unlock other boxes.

A key with the same number as a box unlocks that box.

There may be keys that do not have corresponding boxes.

You can assume all keys are positive integers.



Output

Return True if all boxes can be opened, otherwise return False.


Example

boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: True

boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: True

boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: False

0-lockboxes.py: Contains the implementation of the canUnlockAll function.

main_0.py: Test file with example cases.


Usage

To run the program, make sure the files are executable, then use the following command:

$ ./main_0.py

Algorithm Description

The solution employs a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach:

It starts with the first box (boxes[0]) unlocked.

A stack is used to explore the keys within the boxes.

Each time a key is found, the corresponding box is unlocked if it hasn't been unlocked before.

The process continues until no new keys are found, at which point the algorithm checks if all boxes have been unlocked.


Time Complexity

Worst-case Time Complexity: O(n + k) where n is the number of boxes and k is the total number of keys across all boxes.

Space Complexity: O(n), due to the use of the stack and set for tracking unlocked boxes.
