# ALX Interview Preparation

## Description

This repository contains solutions to various interview preparation problems, with a focus on algorithmic challenges that are commonly encountered in technical interviews. Each directory represents a project, which includes one or more coding tasks aimed at improving problem-solving and programming skills.

### Table of Contents

- [0x00-pascal_triangle](./0x00-pascal_triangle): Pascal's Triangle implementation in Python.

### Projects

#### 0x00. Pascal's Triangle
The goal of this project is to generate Pascal's Triangle up to the nth row using Python.

- **Algorithm**: The triangle is generated using a list of lists, where each element is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. Edge values are always 1.
- **Skills Practiced**: List comprehensions, nested loops, and arithmetic operations.
- **Directory**: `0x00-pascal_triangle`.

### Usage
Each project comes with its own testing script or file. You can run the tests to verify the correctness of the implemented solution.

For example, to test the Pascal's Triangle implementation, navigate to the `0x00-pascal_triangle` directory and run:

```bash
$ ./0-main.py
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Basic knowledge of algorithms and data structures.
